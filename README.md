# brainci
A collection of tools to record EEG brainwaves from a Muse device, train an artificial intelligence with the collected brain data to predict terms from thoughts.

bci-record.py:
- Starts "bci-stream" to initate the Muse EEG stream
- Records EEG brainwaves from a Muse 2 device
- Visual stimulation for a defined set of terms (1,2,3 by default)
- Marker stream to mark the recorded samples with the displayed terms
- Allows to record "training" and "sample" data for the AI

bci-stream:
- Starts Muse LSL stream
- Please adapt the Mac address of your Muse 2 device in this file

bci-combine.py:
- Combines and formats multiple recorded EEG datafiles in a specified directory

bci-ai.py:
- Reads the combined and formatted EEG datafile
- Trains a "tensorflow" artificial intelligence with the provided data
- Saves the trained model

bci-predict.py:
- Reads a combined and formatted EEG sample
- Restores a previously saved trained model
- Runs a prediction accross all the collected samples
- Output the prediction of each term in percent

Enjoy, hope you have fun with it!
